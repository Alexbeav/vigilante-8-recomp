# Vigilante 8 release feasibility

Status: candidate Windows setup host

The operator confirmed that the promoted private build reaches gameplay. This
source-only repository does not inherit that result. It must pass the exact
package setup, generation, build, and startup gates before public release.

The supported serial set is $(@{ordinal=10; slug=vigilante-8; title=Vigilante 8; serials=System.Object[]; expected_disc_count=1; identity_complete=True; risks=System.Object[]}.serials -join ', '). The package uses
the owned-input distribution model. The player supplies the supported disc set
and BIOS, and the setup host builds the playable executable locally.

The package must not contain a disc, BIOS, generated retail code, save, capture,
prebuilt playable executable, or private absolute path.
