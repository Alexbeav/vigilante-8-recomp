# Vigilante 8 release feasibility

Status: `bootstrap_verified`; Windows package pending R2 and R3

The operator confirmed that the promoted private build reaches gameplay. This
meets the `bootstrap_verified` boundary. The source-only Windows package
builds locally. It must still pass exact-package setup, startup, and remote-byte
gates before public release.

The supported serial set is `SLES-01212`. The package uses
the owned-input distribution model. The player supplies the supported disc set
and BIOS, and the setup host builds the playable executable locally.

The package must not contain a disc, retail BIOS, generated retail code, save, capture,
prebuilt playable executable, or private absolute path.
