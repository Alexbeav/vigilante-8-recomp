## Current state

The operator confirmed gameplay in the private promoted package. This meets
the `bootstrap_verified` boundary. The source-only Windows package builds
locally. Exact-package setup, startup, and remote-byte gates remain open.

## Open gates

1. Complete exact-package setup and a 10-second startup.
2. Run the regional and title-risk canaries from exact ZIPs.
3. Audit every downloaded private draft.
4. Bind publication authorization to the exact release manifest.

## Corpus consulted

The release work uses PSX-PUB-004, PSX-PUB-006, PSX-WIN-004,
PSX-WIN-005, PSX-WIN-006, and PSX-PUB-011.

## v0.3.3 setup correction

The source now uses `Vigilante_8_Recompiled` as the only setup executable name. The batch source
gate passes. The exact-ZIP automatic-relaunch canary and remote release audit
remain open. Public `v0.3.0` remains unchanged.
