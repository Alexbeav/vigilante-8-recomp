# Development log

## 2026-09-02 — canonical multi-track disc identity

The public `v0.3.3` manifest used the merged whole-disc BIN identity, while
the verifier hashes the first BIN named by the CUE. Release `v0.3.4` uses the
canonical Track 01 identity and keeps the merged identity as a compatibility
entry. Verification passed with the owned 13-track Europe disc and rejected
an unrelated disc.

## 2026-09-01 — setup executable-name parity

The public `v0.3.0` source used different CMake and setup-relaunch executable
names. The corrected source uses `Vigilante_8_Recompiled` in all three title-owned paths.
`Test-SetupExecutableNameParity.ps1` passes. Exact-ZIP automatic relaunch is
still required before release.

## 2026-09-04 v0.3.6 POSIX setup-copy candidate

This candidate pins PSXRecomp 08ec704a974b1f3a16335b4afeb340b9eff19926 and recomp-ui be8ac1d03ee19d55394b5a5f2d9d1506edd56659.
Linux and macOS packages use native CMake, Ninja, Python, C, and C++ tools.
Windows keeps the portable toolchain route. This change does not change game
code or the graduation state. Build-only CI and every exact-package release
gate must pass before publication.
